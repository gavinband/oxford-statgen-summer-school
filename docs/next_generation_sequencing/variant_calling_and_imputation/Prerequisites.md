# Getting the data

To get the data download and unzip this tarball:

Change dir to the root and download:
```
cd ~
wget https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/projects/oxford_statgen_summer_school/day_one_afternoon.tgz
```

Extract:
```
tar -xzf day_one_afternoon.tgz
```

You should now have a folder called `variant_calling_and_imputation`.  Let's delete the tarball and change into it:

```
rm day_one_afternoon.tgz
cd variant_calling_and_imputation
```

When you're ready, head on to [the practical itself](README.md).
