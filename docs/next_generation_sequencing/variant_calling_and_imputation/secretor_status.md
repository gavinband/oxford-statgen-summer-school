# Examining secretor status

The SNP rs601338 at `chr19:48,703,417` in *FUT2* determines whether an individual secrets the Lewis
antigen. An individual who is homozygous AA doesn't secret Lewis antigen ("non-secretors"), and
everything else does ("secretors"). We have provided a file
(`GGVP/GGVP_secretor_status.txt`) that includes the real secretor status for these individuals.

**Question**. How accurate is the secretor status called from imputation, in comparison to the real data provided?
