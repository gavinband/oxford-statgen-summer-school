# Morning session: basic next-generation sequence data analysis

In this tutorial we will demonstrate a basic pipeline for analysing paired-end short-read genomic
sequencing data. We will start with raw data in a FASTQ file, inspect quality control metrics,
align the data, and then use it to look for genetic variation.

To get started, go [to and get the prerequisites](Prerequisites.md).
