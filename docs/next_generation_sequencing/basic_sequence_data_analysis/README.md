# Basic next-generation sequence data analysis

In this tutorial we will work with a single FASTQ file (the output of an Illumina short-read
sequencing run) and process it to make it 'analysis-ready'. Along the way we will inspect data
quality, assess error rates, align the data and use it to look for genomic variants.

To get started, go [to and get the prerequisites](Prerequisites.md).
