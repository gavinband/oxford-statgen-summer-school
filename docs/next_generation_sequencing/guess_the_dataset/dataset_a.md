(For index URL, add `.bai`).


You should be familiar with this type of data by now, as it's what the [earlier
practical](../basic_sequence_data_analysis/README.md) was all about. The data has 150bp paired-end reads and was
generated on the [Illumina Novaseq 6000](https://emea.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/novaseq.html) platform.

:::tip IGV hints

This is a good point to try a few options to get used to IGV.

* For paired-end data, try the 'view as pairs' option. It can be found in the context menu, obtained by right-clicking
  anywhere on the track.

* Try clicking on a read.  What is all that info?  Where does it come from?

* Try moving around and zooming in/out.  

* If you don't like how reads are displayed, try 'collapsed', 'expanded', or 'squished' from the context menu.  Which one do you like best?

## Questions

Can you find:

* a heterozygous SNP?  A homozygous SNP?
* an INDEL (short insertion or deletion variant)?

When you're ready, move on to [Dataset B](dataset_b.md).
