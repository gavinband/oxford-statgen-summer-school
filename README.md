# Oxford Statistical Genomics Summer School resources
## Day one - sequence data analysis

This website contains practicals for the 2022 [Oxford Statistical Genomics Summer
School](https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/oxford-statistical-genomics-summer-school).

## Contibuting

The website is currently built using docusaurus. Markdown documents go in `docs/`. I guess
notebooks could go in docs/ as well, or they go somewhere else if you wanted e.g. a new
`notebooks/` folder.
